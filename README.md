# Algorithm Archive 📚🧠

**A treasure chest of essential algorithms, because reinventing the wheel every time is overrated.**

Welcome to the **Algorithm Archive**—a collection of must-know algorithms that every developer needs in their toolkit! From sorting your way out of chaos to searching for the meaning of life (or just a number in an array), this repository has it all.

## What’s inside?
- 📜 **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and their faster, cooler cousins.
- 🔍 **Search Algorithms**: Binary Search, Linear Search, and more ways to find stuff.
- 🧮 **Data Structure Magic**: Traversals, heaps, stacks—your survival guide to coding interviews.
- 🤓 **Algorithmic Patterns**: Sliding windows, divide-and-conquer, and other tricks to make you look smarter.
- ⚙️ **Tests Included**: Because bugs don’t belong in your algorithms.

## Why this repo?

Because algorithms are like jokes—if you have to explain them, you’re probably doing it wrong. This archive is your one-stop shop for learning, refreshing, and teaching the algorithms that make the coding world go round.

Happy coding! 🚀
